    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Number of children in Primary 1 receiving a review with valid height and weight data recorded. These statistics have been calculated using the UK 1990 growth reference standards. These are widely accepted as the reference for growth screening in children over four years of age in the UK.

The statistics are derived from height and weight measurements recorded at routine health reviews or selective medicals for children in Primary 1 for NHS Boards in Scotland which participate in the Child Health Systems Programme School system (CHSP School). The number of children measured relates to children with valid height and weight data recorded on the CHSP School.

The number of NHS Boards participating in the CHSP School system and recording reviews has increased since 2000/01 from four to all fourteen Boards in Scotland. This has resulted in an increase in the proportion of children in Primary 1 across Scotland included in the BMI statistics, from approximately 22% in 2000/01 to 92% in 2011/12. Therefore the trend for &#x27;All participating NHS Boards&#x27; should be interpreted with a degree of caution. The data for 2011/12 covers all CHP/Council areas in Scotland for the first time (this is the first year that all areas of NHS Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde (NHS GG&amp;C) have recorded height and weight measurements for Primary 1 children on the CHSP School system).</p>
