    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>This report is based on estimates of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for Scottish agriculture, as reported in the Scottish Greenhouse Gas Statistics 2023 and average emission and nitrogen use estimates from the Farm Business Survey (FBS). </p>

    <h2>Long description</h2>
    <div class="description"><p>The report includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Results for total Scottish agriculture GHG emissions split by <strong>agricultural subsector</strong> (e.g. suckler beef, arable, dairy etc). These subsectors align more closely with agricultural activity and provide a different breakdown to the categories used in the Scottish Greenhouse Gas Statistics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Average whole farm emissions of different farm types</strong> (e.g. lowland cattle and sheep, general cropping, LFA (less favoured area) sheep etc). Farms are assigned to a farm type based on their primary output. The results also show the variation in emissions within each farm type. This is based on FBS data and is weighted to cover commercial sized farms in Scotland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Average emission intensity of specific agricultural outputs of different farm types.</strong> For example, estimates for the average emission intensity of a kg deadweight (dwt) of beef in an LFA cattle farm, a lowland cattle and sheep farm and an LFA cattle and sheep farm. Agricultural outputs are the products of farm enterprises – agricultural activities within a farm business. Estimates are not weighted because they are based on a sub-sample of data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Average farm level nitrogen use across different farm types.</strong> Estimates are weighted using the same methodology described above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analysis of whole farm emissions, emission intensity of agricultural outputs and nitrogen use are based on farms in the FBS. This is a survey of around 400 commercial farms (whose standard output exceeds around £20,000). The sample excludes farm types not in receipt of support payments (such as pigs, poultry and horticulture). Some results are weighted to better reflect the wider population. Some results are presented unweighted because they are based on sub-samples of data. Where the sample sizes are small, data can be more highly variable and have a wider margin of uncertainty.</p>
