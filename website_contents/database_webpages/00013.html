    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Data and information on the types and quantities of waste generated and managed across Scotland, reported by the Scottish Enviroment Protection Agency (SEPA)</p>

    <h2>Long description</h2>
    <div class="description"><h2>Waste Data</h2>
<p>SEPA is responsible for reporting national waste statistics to the Scottish Government and European Union among others. As regulator, SEPA also has a duty to assess whether waste management sites comply with the conditions of their licence or permit.</p>
<p>To do this, SEPA collects and verifies data from a number of sources, mainly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operators of all licensed and most permitted waste management sites</li>
<li>Operators of certain activities exempt from full waste management licensing</li>
<li>Local authorities</li>
</ul>
<p>A strategy for improving waste data in Scotland, also known as the Waste data strategy 2017, aims to deliver Scotland's current and future waste data needs as we move towards a more resource-focused future. Written in partnership by SEPA, Zero Waste Scotland and Scottish Government, it outlines what we will achieve and how we are going to co-ordinate and deliver a plan that will support Scotland's transition to a more circular economy, where products and materials are kept in high value use for as long as possible.</p>
<p>Most of the data are presented as interactive tools with tables and charts that can be filtered to suit. All the data are available in Excel format.</p>
<p>SEPA also collects and reports on offsite transfers of waste from industrial sites through the Scottish Pollutant Release Inventory (SPRI)</p>
<h2>Waste data for Scotland</h2>
<p>The Scotland’s Environment Waste Discover Data tool presents waste from all sources, i.e. from households, the construction and demolition sector, and from commerce and industry. The tool shows a break-down of waste types from 2011 onwards and the trend for Scottish waste landfilled since 2005. All data can be exported to Excel if required. </p>
<p>The Scotland’s Environment Household Waste Discover Data tool shows waste from household sources only. The tool shows a break-down of household waste generated and managed by waste type from 2011 onwards and the trends for household waste generated, recycled and managed since 2004. All data can be exported to Excel if required.</p>
<p>As well as the Discover tools, the table below shows:</p>
<p>Excel summaries of waste data generated and managed across Scotland;
Excel summaries of the types and quantities of waste landfilled and incinerated in Scotland each year;
commentary and quality reports to accompany the data.
All the waste data reported on this page are now published as Official Statistics. You can find out more about this from the Official Statistics webpage.</p>
<p>The publication schedule for all the data on this page is set out on our Waste data reporting page.</p>
<p>Available information: Commentary documents, Excel data tables and quality reports</p></div>
