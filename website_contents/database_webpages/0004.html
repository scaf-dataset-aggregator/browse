    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>The dataset comes from Roboflow, a computer vision website. There are 81 images, one of which appears to be from South Korea. The reason I&#x27;m writing this abstract myself is that the description only mentions some use cases for the project.</p>

    <h2>Long description</h2>
    <div class="description"><p>Here are a few use cases for this project:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Automated Sorting in Agriculture:</strong> The "potatoes" computer vision model can help sort and grade potatoes based on their classes during harvesting, enabling farmers to easily separate marketable potatoes from those that require further processing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quality Control in Food Manufacturing</strong>: The model can be utilized in food production facilities to monitor and maintain quality standards in potato-based products like chips, crisps, and fries, ensuring that only the appropriate potato classes are used in each product line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Smart Grocery Shopping Applications</strong>: Integrate the "potatoes" model into grocery shopping apps or in-store cameras to help customers identify different potato classes quickly, making it easier for them to find and purchase their preferred variety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Potato Disease and Pest Detection</strong>: Combine the "potatoes" model with additional training data on common potato diseases and pests, to enable early identification and preventive measures, thereby minimizing crop damage and yield loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Educational and Research Tool</strong>: The "potatoes" model can be used by researchers, students, and potato enthusiasts to study and understand the morphological differences and nuances among various potato classes, fostering new insights and discoveries in potato cultivation and breeding.</p>
</li>
