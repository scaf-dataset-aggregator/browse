    <p>These family food datasets contain more detailed information than the ‘Family Food’ report and mainly provide statistics from 2001 onwards.

These spreadsheets are updated annually when a new edition of the ‘Family Food’ report is published.

    <h2>Long description</h2>
    <div class="description"><p>These family food datasets contain more detailed information than the ‘Family Food’ report and mainly provide statistics from 2001 onwards. The UK household purchases and the UK household expenditure spreadsheets include statistics from 1974 onwards. These spreadsheets are updated annually when a new edition of the ‘Family Food’ report is published.</p>
<p>The ‘purchases’ spreadsheets give the average quantity of food and drink purchased per person per week for each food and drink category. The ‘nutrient intake’ spreadsheets give the average nutrient intake (e.g. energy, carbohydrates, protein, fat, fibre, minerals and vitamins) from food and drink per person per day. The ‘expenditure’ spreadsheets give the average amount spent in pence per person per week on each type of food and drink. Several different breakdowns are provided in addition to the UK averages including figures by region, income, household composition and characteristics of the household reference person.</p></div>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <div >Data is collected for a sample of households in the United Kingdom using self-reported diaries supported by till receipts of all purchases, including food eaten out, over a two week period. Where possible quantities are recorded in the diaries but otherwise estimated. Current estimates are based on data collected in the Family Food Module of the Living Costs and Food Survey and on adjusted data collected in the National Food Survey.</div>
