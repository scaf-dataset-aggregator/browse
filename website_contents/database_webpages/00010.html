    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>The UK Biobank is an extremely large dataset of healthcare information relating to half a million volunteer participants, thanks to a project where many individuals from the UK agreed to be studied for 30 years. The dataset also has many fields, ranging from blood samples to lifestyle. 
The data is accessible for health-care related researchers, after making a formal request.</p>

    <h2>Long description</h2>
    <div class="description"><h2>UK Biobank</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p><strong>UK Biobank</strong> is a large-scale, long-term <strong>prospective cohort study</strong> collecting biological and health-related data from around <strong>500,000 participants</strong> across the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Participants aged <strong>40 to 69 years</strong> were recruited between <strong>2006 and 2010</strong> and consented to share their health data and be followed for at least <strong>30 years</strong>. The project’s aim is to <strong>support research into the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease</strong> across biomedical and population health fields.</p>
<p><em>Nature</em> has described UK Biobank as an “unprecedented open access database.”</p>
<hr />
<h3>Data Collected</h3>
<p>UK Biobank holds more than <strong>10,000 variables</strong> on its participants, covering a wide range of data types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Biological samples</strong> (blood, urine, saliva)</li>
<li><strong>Physical and physiological measurements</strong> (height, weight, blood pressure, bone density, lung capacity)</li>
<li><strong>Imaging data</strong> (body, brain, bone, and eye scans)</li>
<li><strong>Activity tracking</strong> and <strong>lifestyle questionnaire</strong> data</li>
<li><strong>Genetic and proteomic</strong> information</li>
</ul>
<p>More than <strong>15 million biological samples</strong> are stored, and the online database exceeds <strong>30 petabytes</strong> of data.
UK Biobank’s <strong>genome sequencing</strong>, <strong>proteomic</strong>, and <strong>imaging</strong> datasets are among the largest in the world.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Study Design</h3>
<p>Each participant visited an <strong>assessment centre</strong> where they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completed questionnaires on lifestyle, medical history, and diet</li>
<li>Underwent physical measurements</li>
<li>Provided blood and urine samples for long-term storage and DNA extraction</li>
</ul>
<p>All participants’ data are linked to their <strong>electronic health records</strong> through the <strong>UK National Health Service (NHS)</strong>. This enables long-term tracking of disease events, prescriptions, and mortality.</p>
<p>Researchers do <strong>not</strong> have direct access to participants, and all records are <strong>strictly anonymised</strong>. Feedback to participants is limited to basic measures (e.g., BMI, blood pressure).
Other findings, such as genetic risks, are <strong>not disclosed</strong> to participants or their doctors to protect privacy and prevent discrimination.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Access for Researchers</h3>
<p>Since <strong>2012</strong>, approved researchers worldwide have been able to apply for access to UK Biobank data for <strong>health-related research</strong> that serves the <strong>public interest</strong>.</p>
<p>A typical study compares groups of participants who developed a particular condition (e.g., cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s) with those who did not, to examine how <strong>genes, lifestyles, and medications</strong> interact to influence disease risk.</p>
<p>By <strong>2017</strong>, UK Biobank had released genetic information for analysis.
At that time, participants had collectively recorded approximately <strong>1.3 million hospitalisations</strong>, <strong>40,000 cancer diagnoses</strong>, and <strong>14,000 deaths</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <div >The volunteers answer questionnaires and do visits in which various samples are collected. The methodology varies based on the data being collected, but a summary page is found here: <a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/about-our-data/our-participants/" target="_blank">https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/about-our-data/our-participants/</a></div>

    <h2>Data collection</h2>
    <p><strong>Collection start:</strong> 01/01/2006, <strong>Collection end:</strong> Unknown</p>
    <strong>Location:</strong> ['United Kingdom', 'Europe']</p>
