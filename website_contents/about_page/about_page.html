    <h1>About SCAF Dataset Aggregator</h1>

      <p>Made by Giancarlo Catalano for SCAF, 2025</p>

    <h2> History of the Dataset Aggregator</h2>
    <p>The Scottish Alliance for Food had a workshop in April 2024 relating to the "Mapping" theme, where it was found that many SCAF members were in possession of data, and that the community would benefit from being able to share and re-use each other's datasets.</p>
    <p>A small grant was obtained, and this website was created! The website follows a fairly simple architecture, and is designed to last for a long time. If you are interested in making a similar website for yourself, you can contact Giancarlo at catalano.giancarlo.00@gmail.com.</p>
