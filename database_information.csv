*   Results for total Scottish agriculture GHG emissions split by **agricultural subsector** (e.g. suckler beef, arable, dairy etc). These subsectors align more closely with agricultural activity and provide a different breakdown to the categories used in the Scottish Greenhouse Gas Statistics.
    
*   **Average whole farm emissions of different farm types** (e.g. lowland cattle and sheep, general cropping, LFA (less favoured area) sheep etc). Farms are assigned to a farm type based on their primary output. The results also show the variation in emissions within each farm type. This is based on FBS data and is weighted to cover commercial sized farms in Scotland.
    
*   **Average emission intensity of specific agricultural outputs of different farm types.** For example, estimates for the average emission intensity of a kg deadweight (dwt) of beef in an LFA cattle farm, a lowland cattle and sheep farm and an LFA cattle and sheep farm. Agricultural outputs are the products of farm enterprises – agricultural activities within a farm business. Estimates are not weighted because they are based on a sub-sample of data.
    
*   **Average farm level nitrogen use across different farm types.** Estimates are weighted using the same methodology described above.
    
*   Analysis of whole farm emissions, emission intensity of agricultural outputs and nitrogen use are based on farms in the FBS. This is a survey of around 400 commercial farms (whose standard output exceeds around £20,000). The sample excludes farm types not in receipt of support payments (such as pigs, poultry and horticulture). Some results are weighted to better reflect the wider population. Some results are presented unweighted because they are based on sub-samples of data.

### Overview

**UK Biobank** is a large-scale, long-term **prospective cohort study** collecting biological and health-related data from around **500,000 participants** across the United Kingdom.

Participants aged **40 to 69 years** were recruited between **2006 and 2010** and consented to share their health data and be followed for at least **30 years**. The project’s aim is to **support research into the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease** across biomedical and population health fields.

*Nature* has described UK Biobank as an “unprecedented open access database.”

---

### Data Collected

UK Biobank holds more than **10,000 variables** on its participants, covering a wide range of data types:

* **Biological samples** (blood, urine, saliva)
* **Physical and physiological measurements** (height, weight, blood pressure, bone density, lung capacity)
* **Imaging data** (body, brain, bone, and eye scans)
* **Activity tracking** and **lifestyle questionnaire** data
* **Genetic and proteomic** information

More than **15 million biological samples** are stored, and the online database exceeds **30 petabytes** of data.
UK Biobank’s **genome sequencing**, **proteomic**, and **imaging** datasets are among the largest in the world.

---

### Study Design

Each participant visited an **assessment centre** where they:

* Completed questionnaires on lifestyle, medical history, and diet
* Underwent physical measurements
* Provided blood and urine samples for long-term storage and DNA extraction

All participants’ data are linked to their **electronic health records** through the **UK National Health Service (NHS)**. This enables long-term tracking of disease events, prescriptions, and mortality.

Researchers do **not** have direct access to participants, and all records are **strictly anonymised**. Feedback to participants is limited to basic measures (e.g., BMI, blood pressure).
Other findings, such as genetic risks, are **not disclosed** to participants or their doctors to protect privacy and prevent discrimination.

---

### Access for Researchers

Since **2012**, approved researchers worldwide have been able to apply for access to UK Biobank data for **health-related research** that serves the **public interest**.

A typical study compares groups of participants who developed a particular condition (e.g., cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s) with those who did not, to examine how **genes, lifestyles, and medications** interact to influence disease risk.

By **2017**, UK Biobank had released genetic information for analysis.
At that time, participants had collectively recorded approximately **1.3 million hospitalisations**, **40,000 cancer diagnoses**, and **14,000 deaths**.

Country- and year-specific areas of change for each land transition between these categories were calculated. A base map for the year 2015 served as a starting point for the change allocation procedure, which, at first, runs backward in time (2015–1960) and, subsequently, forward in time (2015–2019). For each time step and country, LUC change was allocated to selected candidate pixels by using ranked gridded class fractions and the data-derived change extents. Each of these iterative procedures yielded a global LUC map, which served as the new base map for the next time step. The following methodological steps were included in the data development:

    Pre-processing and harmonisation of land use/cover maps: Reclassifying with a common generalised classification scheme• Probability maps for land use/cover categories: Annual maps of the average area fractions of each land use/cover category. Based on this, probability maps for the final LUC categories were derived, which were the basis of the change allocation procedure.
    Probability maps for land use/cover categories: Annual maps of the average area fractions of each land use/cover category. Based on this, probability maps for the final LUC categories were derived, which were the basis of the change allocation procedure.
    Base map calibration (calibrating the Copernicus LC100 Global Land Cover map for the reference year 2015 to FAO land use statistics).
    Preparing datasets for national LUC change matrices based on FAO statistics (annual net changes per country) and remote sensing products (annual gross changes per country).
    Change allocation: Based on the recalculated country- and year-specific transition matrices, the magnitude of LUC change was distributed over the grid by means of corresponding probability maps for each LUC category. This procedure was undertaken iteratively for each year (in a back- and forward mode starting from the base year 2015, respectively), for each individual country and for each land transition between two LUC categories.

SEPA is responsible for reporting national waste statistics to the Scottish Government and European Union among others. As regulator, SEPA also has a duty to assess whether waste management sites comply with the conditions of their licence or permit.

To do this, SEPA collects and verifies data from a number of sources, mainly:

- Operators of all licensed and most permitted waste management sites
- Operators of certain activities exempt from full waste management licensing
- Local authorities

A strategy for improving waste data in Scotland, also known as the Waste data strategy 2017, aims to deliver Scotland's current and future waste data needs as we move towards a more resource-focused future. Written in partnership by SEPA, Zero Waste Scotland and Scottish Government, it outlines what we will achieve and how we are going to co-ordinate and deliver a plan that will support Scotland's transition to a more circular economy, where products and materials are kept in high value use for as long as possible.

Most of the data are presented as interactive tools with tables and charts that can be filtered to suit. All the data are available in Excel format.

SEPA also collects and reports on offsite transfers of waste from industrial sites through the Scottish Pollutant Release Inventory (SPRI)

## Waste data for Scotland
The Scotland’s Environment Waste Discover Data tool presents waste from all sources, i.e. from households, the construction and demolition sector, and from commerce and industry. The tool shows a break-down of waste types from 2011 onwards and the trend for Scottish waste landfilled since 2005. All data can be exported to Excel if required. 

The Scotland’s Environment Household Waste Discover Data tool shows waste from household sources only. The tool shows a break-down of household waste generated and managed by waste type from 2011 onwards and the trends for household waste generated, recycled and managed since 2004. All data can be exported to Excel if required.

As well as the Discover tools, the table below shows:

Excel summaries of waste data generated and managed across Scotland;
Excel summaries of the types and quantities of waste landfilled and incinerated in Scotland each year;
commentary and quality reports to accompany the data.
All the waste data reported on this page are now published as Official Statistics. You can find out more about this from the Official Statistics webpage.

The publication schedule for all the data on this page is set out on our Waste data reporting page.

**Food and You** was the main consumer survey by the Food Standards Agency (FSA), first carried out in 2010, with further waves in 2012 and 2014. The survey collected self-reported data from UK adults (aged 16+) living in private households about their food-related behaviours, attitudes, knowledge and practices. This includes data on food purchasing, storage, preparation, consumption, eating habits, where people eat out or get takeaways, and experiences of food poisoning or food-safety concerns.  [data.gov.uk](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/843d1a1e-c80b-4c55-89eb-5cf1185dbe3c/food-and-you)

In 2020 the FSA replaced that survey with **Food and You 2**, commissioned in September 2019. Fieldwork began in July 2020. Food and You 2 uses a different methodology (a “push-to-web” mixed-mode survey rather than face-to-face) and is designed as a repeated cross-sectional survey to monitor changing patterns of consumer behaviour, attitudes and food-related issues over time.  [food.gov.uk](https://www.food.gov.uk/research/food-and-you-2-technical-report-introduction)

The “2” in the name indicates this new version (post-2019), reflecting the change from the earlier biennial face-to-face survey to a more efficient, flexible design that allows more frequent waves, broader topic coverage and adaptation to emerging issues.  [food.gov.uk, technical report](https://www.food.gov.uk/research/food-and-you-2-technical-report-introduction)

### Sample sizes and response context  

- In Wave 1 of Food and You 2 (July–October 2020), there were 9,319 individual returns.  [acmsf.food.gov.uk](https://acmsf.food.gov.uk/committeeworkin2021)  
- The largest issued sample size was in Wave 1 (21,053 addresses), then dropped to 13,922 in Wave 2, and remained 14,115 in Waves 3 and 4.  [Report on all waves](https://doc.ukdataservice.ac.uk/doc/8815/mrdoc/pdf/8815_fy2_all_waves_technical_report.pdf)  
- For Wave 5, with inclusion of reserve addresses, the issued sample size was 16,115 addresses.  [doc.ukdataservice.ac.uk](https://doc.ukdataservice.ac.uk/doc/8815/mrdoc/pdf/8815_fy2_all_waves_technical_report.pdf)  
- For Wave 6 and Wave 7, the issued sample size was 14,500.  [doc.ukdataservice.ac.uk](https://doc.ukdataservice.ac.uk/doc/8814/mrdoc/pdf/8814_fy2_wave_6_technical_report.pdf)  
- For Wave 8 (when Scotland was included), the total issued sample size was 18,850 (15,000 for England/Wales/Northern Ireland + 3,850 for Scotland).  [doc.ukdataservice.ac.uk](https://doc.ukdataservice.ac.uk/doc/8815/mrdoc/pdf/8815_fy2_all_waves_technical_report_2024.pdf)  
- In Scotland for Wave 8, 1,377 adults from 954 households responded (response rate ~ 24.8%) — of these, 68.4% completed online and 31.6% via the postal questionnaire.  [Food Standards Scotland](https://www.foodstandards.gov.scot/publications-and-research/publications/food-and-you-2-survey-scotland-wave-8-key-findings)

Because up to two adults per household can participate, the number of individual returns is typically higher than the number of households.  [Food Standards Agency](https://www.food.gov.uk/research/food-and-you-2-technical-report-introduction)

The survey uses stratified random probability sampling from the Royal Mail Postcode Address File (PAF), stratified by local authority and deprivation, to ensure broad geographic and socio-economic representativity.

## Topic areas / Modules

Food and You 2 uses a modular questionnaire design. Some modules are asked **every wave** (core modules), others rotate and are asked less frequently (e.g. every 6 months, 12 months, or 24 months), depending on the wave schedule and content.  [Food Standards Agency](https://www.food.gov.uk/research/fy2-wave-6-technical-report-appendices)

| Module / Topic Area | What it covers |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Demographics & household info; dietary preferences; food hypersensitivities | Age, household composition, which household member does cooking/shopping, reported allergies or intolerances, diet preferences |
| Food you can trust (core) | Confidence in food safety, food authenticity, trust in the supply chain and food industry, trust in FSA |
| Food concerns (core) | Worries about food safety, quality, origin, packaging and broader food concerns |
| Household food security (core) | Food insecurity, changes in food access or consumption due to financial or other constraints, use of food banks or social supermarkets |
| Eating at Home (domestic food practices) | Food storage, cooking, reheating, chilling, hygiene behaviours (cleaning, hand-washing, cross-contamination etc.) |
| Food shopping behaviours | Shopping habits, confidence in allergen information, reactions to allergen/food alerts, attitudes toward provenance, sustainability, meat alternatives |
| Eating Out & Takeaways | Behaviour and attitudes when eating out or ordering takeaways; awareness/use of hygiene ratings schemes, convenience, dietary choice outside home |
| Food hypersensitivities / allergies (in-depth) | Detailed information about self-reported allergies/intolerances, whether diagnosed, management, avoidance behaviours, reaction experiences |
| Emerging issues / Sustainable / Healthy / Novel diets | Attitudes toward sustainable diets, consumption of meat alternatives, interest in novel/genetic food technologies, ethical or environmental food considerations |

\* Core modules such as “Food you can trust”, “Food concerns”, “Household food security”, and Demographics/household info are typically asked in every wave. Other modules rotate between waves depending on the survey schedule and priorities.  [Food Standards Agency](https://www.food.gov.uk/research/fy2-wave-6-technical-report-appendices)

## Important notes 

- Because of the **methodological change** between the original Food and You (face-to-face, biennial) and Food and You 2 (push-to-web mixed mode, biannual), **data from the two surveys should not be directly compared**. Food and You 2 constitutes a new time series.  [Food Standards Agency](https://www.food.gov.uk/research/food-and-you-2-technical-report-introduction)  
- Not all modules are asked every wave. For longitudinal or trend analysis on certain topics (e.g. food shopping, sustainable diets, detailed hypersensitivity questions), it is important to check which wave(s) include the module.  [Food Standards Agency](https://www.food.gov.uk/research/fy2-wave-6-technical-report-appendices)  
- Survey responses are **self-reported**. As in all social surveys, what respondents say they do (attitudes, behaviours) may differ from actual behaviour — especially for sensitive questions like hygiene or food-security.  
- Use of full microdata (e.g. SPSS datasets) or country-level breakdowns may require compliance with licensing terms (e.g. via UK Data Service).  
- When citing the dataset in publications or reports, you should clearly reference the wave (or waves) used, the technical report, and (if relevant) country coverage (e.g. noting inclusion of Scotland from Wave 8).
