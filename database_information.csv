*   Results for total Scottish agriculture GHG emissions split by **agricultural subsector** (e.g. suckler beef, arable, dairy etc). These subsectors align more closely with agricultural activity and provide a different breakdown to the categories used in the Scottish Greenhouse Gas Statistics.
    
*   **Average whole farm emissions of different farm types** (e.g. lowland cattle and sheep, general cropping, LFA (less favoured area) sheep etc). Farms are assigned to a farm type based on their primary output. The results also show the variation in emissions within each farm type. This is based on FBS data and is weighted to cover commercial sized farms in Scotland.
    
*   **Average emission intensity of specific agricultural outputs of different farm types.** For example, estimates for the average emission intensity of a kg deadweight (dwt) of beef in an LFA cattle farm, a lowland cattle and sheep farm and an LFA cattle and sheep farm. Agricultural outputs are the products of farm enterprises – agricultural activities within a farm business. Estimates are not weighted because they are based on a sub-sample of data.
    
*   **Average farm level nitrogen use across different farm types.** Estimates are weighted using the same methodology described above.
    
*   Analysis of whole farm emissions, emission intensity of agricultural outputs and nitrogen use are based on farms in the FBS. This is a survey of around 400 commercial farms (whose standard output exceeds around £20,000). The sample excludes farm types not in receipt of support payments (such as pigs, poultry and horticulture). Some results are weighted to better reflect the wider population. Some results are presented unweighted because they are based on sub-samples of data.

### Overview

**UK Biobank** is a large-scale, long-term **prospective cohort study** collecting biological and health-related data from around **500,000 participants** across the United Kingdom.

Participants aged **40 to 69 years** were recruited between **2006 and 2010** and consented to share their health data and be followed for at least **30 years**. The project’s aim is to **support research into the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease** across biomedical and population health fields.

*Nature* has described UK Biobank as an “unprecedented open access database.”

---

### Data Collected

UK Biobank holds more than **10,000 variables** on its participants, covering a wide range of data types:

* **Biological samples** (blood, urine, saliva)
* **Physical and physiological measurements** (height, weight, blood pressure, bone density, lung capacity)
* **Imaging data** (body, brain, bone, and eye scans)
* **Activity tracking** and **lifestyle questionnaire** data
* **Genetic and proteomic** information

More than **15 million biological samples** are stored, and the online database exceeds **30 petabytes** of data.
UK Biobank’s **genome sequencing**, **proteomic**, and **imaging** datasets are among the largest in the world.

---

### Study Design

Each participant visited an **assessment centre** where they:

* Completed questionnaires on lifestyle, medical history, and diet
* Underwent physical measurements
* Provided blood and urine samples for long-term storage and DNA extraction

All participants’ data are linked to their **electronic health records** through the **UK National Health Service (NHS)**. This enables long-term tracking of disease events, prescriptions, and mortality.

Researchers do **not** have direct access to participants, and all records are **strictly anonymised**. Feedback to participants is limited to basic measures (e.g., BMI, blood pressure).
Other findings, such as genetic risks, are **not disclosed** to participants or their doctors to protect privacy and prevent discrimination.

---

### Access for Researchers

Since **2012**, approved researchers worldwide have been able to apply for access to UK Biobank data for **health-related research** that serves the **public interest**.

A typical study compares groups of participants who developed a particular condition (e.g., cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s) with those who did not, to examine how **genes, lifestyles, and medications** interact to influence disease risk.

By **2017**, UK Biobank had released genetic information for analysis.
At that time, participants had collectively recorded approximately **1.3 million hospitalisations**, **40,000 cancer diagnoses**, and **14,000 deaths**.
