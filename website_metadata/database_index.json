    "abstract": "The number and percentage of babies who received a health visitor first visit and whose feeding status is known. These statistics are derived from data collected at the health visitor First Visit review (at around 10 days old) and the 6-8 week review, and recorded on the child health pre-school system (CHSP Pre-School). At these reviews, the health professional (normally a health visitor) records whether a mother is exclusively breastfeeding (baby is fed breast milk only), mixed feeding (baby is fed both breast and formula milk), or if the baby is being fed formula milk only.\r\n\r\nThe overall breastfeeding rate includes babies who are exclusively breastfed and babies who are mixed breast and formula fed. Some information may have been suppressed or adjusted to preserve patient confidentiality.\r\n\r\nMore details, including a statistical commentary, are available on the infant feeding pages of the NHS ISD website.\r\n\r\nFurther details on the methodology used to create this dataset are available in the accompanying technical report.",

    "abstract": "Number of children in Primary 1 receiving a review with valid height and weight data recorded. These statistics have been calculated using the UK 1990 growth reference standards. These are widely accepted as the reference for growth screening in children over four years of age in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe statistics are derived from height and weight measurements recorded at routine health reviews or selective medicals for children in Primary 1 for NHS Boards in Scotland which participate in the Child Health Systems Programme School system (CHSP School). The number of children measured relates to children with valid height and weight data recorded on the CHSP School.\r\n\r\nThe number of NHS Boards participating in the CHSP School system and recording reviews has increased since 2000/01 from four to all fourteen Boards in Scotland. This has resulted in an increase in the proportion of children in Primary 1 across Scotland included in the BMI statistics, from approximately 22% in 2000/01 to 92% in 2011/12. Therefore the trend for &#x27;All participating NHS Boards&#x27; should be interpreted with a degree of caution. The data for 2011/12 covers all CHP/Council areas in Scotland for the first time (this is the first year that all areas of NHS Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde (NHS GG&amp;C) have recorded height and weight measurements for Primary 1 children on the CHSP School system).",
